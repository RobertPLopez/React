What is functional programming 
- a method of organizaing code in a way that 
    - minimize mutation and state change
    - keeps functions indpendent of external data
    - treats funciotns as first-class citizens 

- applciaiton include: 
    - controlled components, we can get the componet into any state we want simply by passing props through it
    - function component
    - higher-order components 
    - recrusive components: basically compoents that use recursion in order to achieve a desired effect
    - partially applied components: subset to create more specfic version 
    - componetn composition: combined multiple components into a single component
