Uncontrolled components: 
- Componetns that keep track of their own states and release data only when some event occurs such the submit event for HTML forms 

Controlled Components
- Components that do not keep track of their own state - all stae is passed in as props (that is, when we use the useState hook with text inputs)
- we prefer controlled componets due to there easy of testing and reuseability
