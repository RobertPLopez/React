What are higher-order compnents 
- a components that return another componetns instead of JSX
- We are adding an extra step inside of the component 
- They are functions that are called to make components 
- These are sued for sharing complex behavior between multiple components (much like with container components)
- add extra fiunctionality to existing componets. For example if you have to use an existing component that someone else built.
