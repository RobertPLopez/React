What are higher-order compnents 
- a components that return another componetns instead of JSX
- We are adding an extra step inside of the component 
- They are functions that are called to make components 
- These are sued for sharing complex behavior between multiple components (much like with container components)
- add extra fiunctionality to existing componets. For example if you have to use an existing component that someone else built. The general pattern can be seen below

import React, {Component} from 'react';

const higherOrderComponent = (DecoratedComponent) => {
  class HOC extends Component {
    render() {
      return <DecoratedComponent />;
    }
  }
  return HOC;
};
