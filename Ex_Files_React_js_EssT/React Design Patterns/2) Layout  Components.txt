What are layout components 

- Normally when we create a component would actually including the div and styles in the componets itself (see below)

    <div> styles={...}
        <h1>Component Code...</h1>
    </div>

- With a layout component pattern we would split out each style into their own components (see below)
- Seperate the componet itself from where its being displayed in the form
- The main idea is that our componetns shouldnt know where they're being displayed

    <div styles={...}>
        {childern}
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>Component Code...</h1>
    </div>
